# Habitat Logistics

React Native mobile app built using Expo. Tested on ios simulator. Please run on the ios simulator. Completed the three tasks given.

## Issues

1. Added custom marker with alphabetic letters to react-native-maps caused performace to slow down significantly. Need to debug. Here's the issue: https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues/3098

2. With more time would love to implement a side swipe filter to delete a task.
